<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a quality test engineer with 7 years of experience identifying potential errors or inconsistencies and making necessary adjustments to achieve the highest quality in software, apps, and websites. </p>

<p>My unique thought process and careful attention to detail helps me see what may have been overlooked allowing me to mitigate issues before they become more significant problems and cost the company thousands of dollars. </p>

<p>I love focusing on the details that I know a consumer would notice and verifying that they will have a seamless experience and build trust which is so important between consumer and company in this field.</p>
